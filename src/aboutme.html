    <h1>Hi! I am Luis Perez.</h1>
    <p>I am currently a student at Kennesaw State University, seeking a Bachelor of Sciences in Software Engineering.
        I'm senior! Before moving to Atlanta, GA, to embark in the journey of being an adult, I lived in Puerto Rico where I'm originally from.
        There I completed a B.S. in Biology but later on decided to change change careers, hence the reason I am studying Software Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the thing that I enjoy on my spare time are napping, watching Anime and recently picked up on playing video games on Xbox One. Also breakfast for dinner is the best.
